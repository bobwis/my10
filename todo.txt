TO-DO LIST

set udp_echo_recv() as callback function for received packets

netuptime timer is only reset after a reboot
phys disconnect / reconnect should update netuptime accordingly

phys disconnect should re-instigate dhcp etc
udp packet numbering should wrap at 24bits on STM - it is 32 bit iinternally


noise + base adc trigger offset needs to be checked  - (its going wrong on high input values 3/4/18)

FreeRTOS xTaskToNotify timeout not operaing as advertised? - check and fix

status packet missing from sample sequence?
